# CNN-Based-Fault-Detection-in-Rotating-Machinery-Using-Vibration-Data

This project focuses on developing a predictive maintenance system for rotating machinery using raw vibration sensor data. A 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was designed and trained to automatically detect and classify various fault conditions, such as bearing faults and rotor imbalances. The model processes time-series vibration signals to learn distinctive patterns associated with different mechanical failures. To improve the model's effectiveness, multiple CNN architectures were tested by increasing the number of convolutional layers and comparing their accuracies. This deep learning-based approach enables timely fault detection, supporting predictive maintenance strategies to minimize unplanned downtime and optimize equipment reliability.
